      p From fairest creatures we desire increase, 
      br 
      p That thereby beauty's rose might never die, 
      br 
      p But as the riper should by time decease, 
      br 
      p His tender heir might bear his memory:
      br 
      p But thou, contracted to thine own bright eyes,
      br 
      p Feed'st thy light's flame with self-substantial fuel,
      br
      p Making a famine where abundance lies, 
      br 
      p Thyself thy foe, to thy sweet self too cruel.
      br 
      p Thou that art now the world's fresh ornament 
      br 
      p And only herald to the gaudy spring, 
      br 
      p Within thine own bud buriest thy content 
      br 
      p And, tender churl, makest waste in niggarding. 
      br 
      p Pity the world, or else this glutton be, 
      br 
      p To eat the world's due, by the grave and thee.
